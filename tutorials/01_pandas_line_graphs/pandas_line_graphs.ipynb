    "In this tutorial we use line graphs to plot various volatility-related time series.  Our analysis objective is to observe the leverage effect: when stock markets suffer losses there is greater volatility.  In order to do this we utilize the built-in visualization capabilities of `pandas`; these capabilities are built on top of the `matplotlib` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike R, in which a single package (`ggplot2`) has become the de facto standard for visualization, in Python there are a variety of packages that form a visualization ecosystem.  The `matplotlib` package is the foundation of much of this ecosystem, and many elements of this ecosystem can be thought of as wrappers around `matplotlib`.  Such packages include `seaborn` (which we will discuss later) and also the visualization tools in `pandas` which we discuss here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API for `matplotlib` is fairly low level, which means you have to specify a lot of different things even for simply graphs.  In practice this can be cumbersome, especiallly for quick and dirty plotting.  Many constituents of the Python visualization ecosystem seek to simplify the creation of *standard* graphs, and this is true of the `pandas` visualization functionality."
